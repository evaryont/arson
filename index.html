<h1>This is arson 2.0, the hot AUR search helper!</h1>

<p>There is 3 primary (and only, ever) functions of arson:</p>

<ul>
<li>Searching</li>
<li>Downloading</li>
<li>Updating</li>
</ul>


<hr />

<h3>Searching</h3>

<p>arson's default fall back action. If arson doesn't understand your parameter,
it will search the AUR with them (after URL escaping them) and display the
results to you, in color.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Downloading</h3>

<p>If you pass arson the parameter "aur/foo" (however many spaces between) it will
attempt to download the package. Or, if the search results only have 1 result,
arson will download that package instead of displaying only 1. If you pass the
category (i.e. "aur-system/arson") arson will understand that as well.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Updating</h3>

<p>If you pass "?" as the only parameter, arson will search through the locally
installed foreign packages (as reported by `pacman -Qm') and return a list
of possible updates available in the AUR.</p>

<hr />

<p>You can not pass anything to arson to get a quick summary of these options.</p>

<p>(ps: Yes, I did report arson as dead, and within the hour restart development
on it. I'm crazy like that, I guess. Also, Daenyth and rson wanted me to
continue. Yay having people who actually like my software!)</p>
