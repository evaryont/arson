This is arson 2.0, the hot AUR search helper!

There is 3 primary (and only, ever) functions of arson:
	* Searching
	* Downloading
	* Updating

-----

Searching

arson's default fallback action. If arson doesn't understand your parameter,
it will search the AUR with them (after URL escaping them) and display the
results to you, in color.

-----

Downloading

If you pass arson the parameter "aur/foo" (however many spaces between) it will
attempt to download the package. Or, if the search results only have 1 result,
arson will download that package instead of displaying only 1.


-----

Updating

If you pass "?" as the only parameter, arson will search through the locally
installed foreign packages (as reported by `pacman -Qm') and return a list
of possible updates available in the AUR.
