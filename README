I no longer have the patience to maintain this program, though that should
have been obvious to anyone looking at the source - it's one large program
instead of the multiple files it should have been.

A similar program, aurb by Gigamo has been made, with heavy influence (dare I
say, based off?) from arson, and therefore is my personal recomendation for
those people looking for a similar program.

To those that enjoyed arson, and still wish it the best, I leave this here for
you. Or as an example to the rest of the community of what not to do for a
program.

It's on AUR, of course: http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=24395
