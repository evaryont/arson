Add a -a/--abs option to download a pacman package from ABS (if it exists)
	- This probably would require a call to rsync directly. Yay?
	- `rsync -mrt --no-motd --delete-after --delete-excluded rsync.archlinux.org::abs/i686/<repo>/<pkg> <$Options[:download_dir]>`

- Setup incremental searching (or whateverever it truly is) instead of the current get-all-and-use-ferret (Reduces deps!) *DONE*

- Add a -l/--long option to show results for anything (searching, information, etc) in a more tabular method *DONE*

 - Add a catch for ambiguous option *DONE*
 -	> /usr/lib/ruby/1.8/optparse.rb:1443:in 'complete': ambiguous option: -s (OptionParser::AmbiguousOption)

Add searching pacman cache for more results. Include repo.
	 - PacNet category searching?
	  \- Wait for another AUR helper to develop an interface 'properly' and rip it, improving/integrating?

 - Fix error: "Error: tint already exists. Pass -f...", change 'tint' to '/full/path/to/tint' and add something about overwriting the directory? *DONE*

- Add searching the pacman cache for AUR depenedencies (provide option to disable) *DONE*
-	- Would have to add a default check to set it to true unless otherwise set (if == nil?)
-	- Example test case (for sure):
-		- gtim => config
