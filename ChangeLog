arson v0.8.7 (DEVELOPMENT - UNRELEASED)
- I got the development bug, sigh... :)
- Fixed Search: Arson incorrectly displayed the total search result count.
Before, it included results from community (which is still in AUR DB...) and
now it doesn't! This also happens to increase search speed (marginally...)
- Updated error message for 'existing dir' to actually mean something more
instead of being so idioticly general. /me hates himself for stupid error
message
- Return of TODO list! I'm just not using RTM...wow I hate the fact that it
doesn't have nestable todos!
- Shifted the existence check to be the first. No more querying AUR to check
if a package exists THEN checking if we already downloaded it!
- Added a catch for ambiguous options. Primary example: -s vs -S, they are
mostly different, but OptionParser gets confused when I haven't actually
specified the differenced them. Baby.
- Switched search to a progressive search. It was relatively easy. Silly me.
- Count is now at the end of the results.
- Rewrite of search. MUCH faster now, would be even faster with the AUR
patches.

arson v0.8.6 (6July2008)
- Added --filter/--foreign options.
- Fixed download: If the package doesn't exist the first time, attempt to 
use the pattern: /packages/<pkg>/<pkg>.tar.gz
- Fixed download: If there are multiple results for a given term, only say
"Not found" if none of the results match the package name.
- Finshed development of arson until AUR JSON is updated (patches are in
testing) unless another bug is found. I still need to create a web site for
arson...

arson v0.8.5 (1June2008)
- PKGBUILD fixes. Oops.
- Completion is now installed.
- added a "beta mode" - just add "beta" anywhere in arson's parameter list,
and ruby-prof will be activated. Requires ruby-prof (sudo gem install
ruby-prof) to be installed.
- The help message is now no longer than 80 charachters wide!

arson v0.8.4 (1June2008)
- Added SpookyET's FISH arson completion script.
- Will add SpookyET's Zsh arson completion whenever.
- Fixed -f paramter, it now actually works!
- Added Ferret searching. To use it: arson -S <keyword> <filter> where
<filter> is a Ferret query (see:
http://ferret.davebalmain.com/api/classes/Ferret/QueryParser.html)
- Added alphabetical sorting to all commands.
- Added a check for the only FileUtils#rm call in the script.
- Still waiting on Aaron or Simo to push 1.5.2 with scj's patches - those will
help in arson's speed immensely!

arson v0.8.3 (30April2008)
- Gah. I still didn't fix -U/--upgrade. Now it actually runs! [Thanks once
more rson451]
- Modified pacman_check_aur_updates to use colorful() and VersionNumber. Now
it only alerts you if there's is an upgrade, not a downgrade:
<ruby-bdb has an update available: 0.6.2-1 -> 0.5.9-1> No more!
- Changed the download code some more. Now it doesn't delete files that have
the same name as the package name (arson, aiccu are examples of this) [Thanks
again benito]

arson v0.8.2 (29April2008)
- Stupid me. When checking the keyword count for commands, I wanted to exclude
:upgrade. I put :update instead. Fixed. (Thanks rson451)
- Changed minitar to extract instead to /pkg/pkg/[files] to instead
/pkg/[files]
- Stopped including ToDo with the distribution. Added ToDo: Move contents of
ToDo to the Remember the Milk public Todo.

arson v0.8.1 (28April2008)
- Bugfix release :/
- Removed the {{{ & }}} folding markers, now I use the syntax markers. Makes 
the comments themselves much easier to read :)
- When using open(http://) arson now uses the same method of retriving the
results (#read instead of #string which only worked sometimes) -Thanks again,
rson451! :)
- arson only displays search results if the package is in AUR. Community
packages can still be downloaded via -D (though, what's the point when pacman
is just as able, if not more so?)
- The tar.gz file is deleted by default now. Changed the -x/--delete option to
-k/--keep to reflect this. Still only if Facets/Archive/Tar/Minitar is
installed (which it is when installing arson for the first time)
- Nobody complained about this, oddly enough. arson.install said it was
installing the Minitar gem when it actually wasn't. Now it doesn't ;)
- arson called without a -COMMAND provides the --help output along with the
'error' message -Thanks [vEX]
- arson now checks if a foreign package (according to pacman) has an update in
AUR - Thanks benito, hope you don't mind that I copied & pasted your code :)
Call -U/--upgrade to see a list
- No longer stops downloading packages when 1 isn't found. - Thanks rson451
- Fixed keyword check, now it excludes :upgrade
- Better error message when calling an invalid option

arson v0.8 (11April2008)
- I'm the energizer bunny! I keep going and going with arson!
- Fixed colorful() error when not providing any keywords
- Now checks if the extraction target already exists
- Added -f/--force option to skip check
- Added warning when you use more than 1 command (for rson451)
- Added Magenta color to the 'crew'! Welcome! lol
- Added minitar gem install, I completley missed that there /was/ a gem!
- Minitar gem is now installed during the first install. Upgraders, run 'gem
install archive-tar-minitar"
- PKGBUILD build() now uses install instead of cp/mkdir
- Added --more-help option, removed note about minitar, see --more-help for
info about installing the minitar gem. If anything else strikes me as useful
for day-to-day use of arson, I may stick it in --more-help or just start a man
page. Dunno if --more-help is here to stay. Enjoy?
- Added color output to help. This is the longest changelog I've written. Fun
- 'arson -D pkg1 pkg2' now downloads both pkg1 and pkg2!
- Multiple pkg info provided when -I is passed multiple packages. (Same vein
as above)
- Skipping 0.7 and going straight for 0.8 cause I feel this is many releases
delayed into 1
- Added OutOfDate checks to -I, -D, -S. Version numbers in Search reaults are
in red if the package is marked out of date, arson now warns you about downloading
an out of date package, and -I is the same, but it now WORKS (as per the fix
above)
- Prevented a possible bug where a user didn't have tput in $PATH. Instead of
calling just tput, it calls the full path (/bin/tput)
- Now provides (not) installed/upgradable info in Search and Info output!
- If a package is in the community repo, Search tells you (so it's community/
instead of aur/) and Download exits into pacman, to avoid the HTML page
download which some users have run into.
- Added Facets as a dependency, it get installed along with arson. This has SO
MUCH STUFF IN IT!
- Facets includes Archive::Tar::Minitar in it's EXTRA libraries. Removed
-e/--dont-extract cli option, removed archive-tar-minitar as a dependency
- Facets includes an ANSICode class, allowing pretty shell output, with full
support for all the effects! Removed tput/ncurses dependency.

arson v0.6.3 (31March2008)
- Switched from using ruby-terminfo to calling /usr/bin/tput. This should work
for sure now, for those who want color and haven't been getting it yet.
- Added Info command (-I, --Info), it's simply a JSON dump. Nice though for
extensive details on any given package.
- Uploaded arson as arson.tar.gz instead of the name makepkg gave it,
hopefully the URLPath bug will stop now.
- Gracefull handling of invalid arguments
- With the switch to tput vs ruby-terminfo, removed ruby-terminfo dependecy
and added ncurses dependency. Now it's mandatory. YOU WILL HAVE COLOR!
- PKGBUILD finally updated correctly; stick the .install script name in
install=()!

arson v0.6.2 (30March2008)
- Added more verbosity, of course only when it's on
- More errors. Didn't report if you tried to download a non-existent package.
- Fixed --save-to not having any effect. (oops)
- Fixed the "<<: Can't convert nil to string" error when trying to run it
without color output enabled
- Re-added arson.install to the sources=() list. Apparently makepkg doesn't
include automattically. Huh.

arson v0.6.1 (30March2008)
- More PKGBUILD fixes. Oops!
- Changed the output a bit 

arson v0.6 (30March2008)
- Added color output + switch. Uses termcap so it's 'smart' already. I don't
expect many people would use the switch. It's there for those who want to
(i.e. feeding it through grep safely)
- Added tarball deletion switch. By default, arson doesn't delete the .tar.gz,it just moves it to the extracted directon
- The verbose switch actually does something now!
- Color output is EVERYWHERE! Yay :D
- Fixed PKGBUILD and arson.install, it now warns you about the gem (thanks
bender02)
- Set the default directory for --save-to to the current directory, now it's
an optional parameter (thanks venox, bender02)
- Added optional dependency for ruby-terminfo http://www.a-k-r.org/ruby-terminfo/
- Started this changelog

arson v0.5.14 (28March2008)
- Initial Upload
