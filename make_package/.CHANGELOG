arson v0.6.2 (..2008)
- Added more verbosity, of course only when it's on
- More errors. Didn't report if you tried to download a non-existent package.
- Fixed --save-to not having any effect. (oops)
- Fixed the "<<: Can't convert nil to string" error when trying to run it
without color output enabled

arson v0.6.1 (30March2008)
- More PKGBUILD fixes. Oops!
- Changed the output a bit 

arson v0.6 (30March2008)
- Added color output + switch. Uses termcap so it's 'smart' already. I don't
expect many people would use the switch. It's there for those who want to
(i.e. feeding it through grep safely)
- Added tarball deletion switch. By default, arson doesn't delete the .tar.gz,it just moves it to the extracted directon
- The verbose switch actually does something now!
- Color output is EVERYWHERE! Yay :D
- Fixed PKGBUILD and arson.install, it now warns you about the gem (thanks
bender02)
- Set the default directory for --save-to to the current directory, now it's
an optional parameter (thanks venox, bender02)
- Added optional dependency for ruby-terminfo http://www.a-k-r.org/ruby-terminfo/
- Started this changelog

arson v0.5.14 (28March2008)
