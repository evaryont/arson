Add support for a configuration file. Command line parameters override conf file options.

Add support for downloading offical build scripts for packages. (i.e. the kernel). Check the ABS script on how, but it's to update soon (~2 weeks @ 2Apr?) so wait

Add libalpm support. Remember 'dl/import'!

#Using libalpm, get status of packages. Possibly just get a list of installed packages + version, and compare that to those returned by the RPC calls. Use short hand for -S results, longerhand for -I results. [e.g. [S] where S is the status, in black if installed, white if not, magenta if upgradeable. I/N/U.]

#When downloading a package, check OutOfDate. If it's set, alert the user, but keep on going anyways. Add some type of 'arson.alerts' file in the extraction dir?

Along with libalpm integration, check the dependencies of the AUR package and propose downloading the required packages that are in AUR as well

#Keep checking the Facets library for gzip decompression. It currently has gzip compression and bzip2 decompression + compression so maybe it's not far off? - Facets has Archive::Tar::Minitar in it as well!

Refactor code to increase speed + reliance on the Extensions and Facets libraries. Those libs are incredibly useful! THEY'RE INSANE!!!!
